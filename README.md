# JUST ANOTHER TEXT EDITOR

## DESCRIPTION

This web application is a text editor that allows users to create and edit content in a browser-based environment. The application has a client-server folder structure and can be started by running npm run start from the root directory. The application uses webpack to bundle JavaScript files, generate HTML files, service workers, and manifest files. The application is compatible with next-gen JavaScript and utilizes IndexedDB for database storage. Users can save their content in the text editor, close and reopen the application, and retrieve their saved content from IndexedDB. The application can be installed as an icon on the desktop and is designed to have static assets pre-cached through a registered service worker using workbox.
